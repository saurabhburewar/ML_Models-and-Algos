# HMM Algorithms


## Viterbi Algorithm
```
python viterbi.py
```

## Evaluation Problem
```
python evalprob.py
```

## HMM training
```

```

The HMM training algorithm is defined in the "trainhmm.py".

## Testing HMM training 
```
python Q4.py
```

## POS tagging
```
python postag.py
```

All results are printed in the terminal.
